## About the CSS

The visual style of this portfolio was designed with a focus on **simplicity, readability, responsiveness, and customization**, utilizing CSS variables for colors and fonts. Highlights include:

- **Custom Fonts:**  
  Imported from Google Fonts:
  - `Krona One` for headings and highlights
  - `Montserrat` for texts and buttons

- **Color Palette:**  
  Use of variables for easy maintenance and color changes:
  ```css
  :root {
      --color-primary: #000000;
      --color-secondary: #F6F6F6;
      --color-tertiary: #22D4FD;
      --color-hover: #272727;
      --font-primary: 'Krona One', sans-serif;
      --font-secondary: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
  }

Place your CSS file in /styles/style.css to properly apply the styles.

## About the About Page


The project features a dedicated page called about.html, accessible via the main menu under About Me.
This page includes:

- Title and introductory text about Joana Santos;
- Two paragraph sections with additional info, experiences, or personal description;
- The same image used on the homepage to ensure visual unity;
- Simplified navigation between Home and About Me pages in the header;
- Fixed footer with the signature “Developed by Alura”.

This content division allows for better presentation of personal and professional information, as well as separating the introduction from the details, making the portfolio more organized and easier to navigate.
